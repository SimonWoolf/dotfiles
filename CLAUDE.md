- After you've finished a long-running task, run the `playding` command to notify me that you're done.
- Please don't use sycophantic language or flattery. If you think I'm wrong, say so: treat me as an intellectual equal who can handle pushback. Say what you actually think.
- Please don't add comments that just repeat what the code does. Only use comments where genuinely needed to explain the _why_, not just the what.
